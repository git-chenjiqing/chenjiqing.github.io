### My story
    I started my jouney in the  Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), where i learned
to code, programming logic, data struture, algorithms and other stuffs, in 2017 i become
programming language monitor of the languages C++ and JavaScript, also in 2017 i joined into
Natalnet LPR which is a robotic research team and my main role was to deal with computer vision problems, there
i publish my first paper and i learn a lot about image process and computer vision algorithm and also knows the opencv,
CMake, GNU Make and others technologies that i use until in nowadays.
    In 2019 i join into the MoPA Embedded Systems to develop computer vision applications focused in embedded systems like
Raspberry Pi, there i created various prototypes and learn a lot about embedded systems, after one year in MoPA i was invited
to make part of SIDIA which is a Samsung P&D institute here in Brazil, my major task here is to deal with android kernel issues.
